Instructions:
    To run this application, first we cd into the student_collection_database directory on the terminal, then cd to 'client'. 
    We then have to "npm install" or "npm i" and then run node studentdatabase.js. 
    You'll get the prompt for the database name (anyone you set), the username(postgres) and the password(postgres). 
    After accessing the database, you'll get all the options to test the code and its impact on the database.
    The SQL script will be found in the 'scripts' folder and you have to open pgAdmin4 and add a database name of your choosing.
    Go to the query tool and upload the sql script ('std.sql') then run it. 
    This would populate the database with the provided values.
